## Godot RTS project
This is a simple rts project. In this game we will control units to destroy enemy base to win the game. Just another take on classic genre. We 
are creating this project using Godot game engine with C#, so it requires dotnetcli and the engine itself to compile.

## Features
Those are the things were going to make
* Up to 2 playable fractions
* Local multiplayer
* Explorable otherworld feature
* Map Editor
* Menu and UI 

We dont have any tests cause it will make things unnecessary complicated
## Install
Beside the engine and the repo itself You have to install dotnetcli in order to compile the project.
so
* clone repo
* build from engine
* ...
* profit

Everything should be fine since used solutions are enough platform independent
